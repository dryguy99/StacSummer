            In addition to the team fees, there will be two additional fees due for the year with the first payment.  There is a seasonal Administration fee of $25.00 from STAC (payable ONLY if you are a new swimmer to STAC), as well as monies due for setup of an escrow account (more information below on the Escrow accounts). Please include the Administration fee (an additional $25.00) with your first payment.<br /><span class="mybold">Please also include the Escrow fee as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">seperate check.</span></span>

          <h3>Escrow Accounts</h3>
          <p>
            The Practice Group fees and Administrative Fee above DO NOT include escrow payments for meet fees.
​Escrow accounts must be set up in the beginning of the season and each family is required to have a meet Escrow Account.  Escrow money is not owned by the team, it is your money to be used only for meet fees.  Escrow money can not be accepted on the same check with Swim Team Registration fees.  Escrow Checks need to be made out separately to STAC.  An initial deposit of $75.00 is expected for families with one swimmer.  Additional swimmers from a family are expected to deposit an additional $25.00 per swimmer.  When an escrow falls below $25.00 the account must be replenished.  Invoices will be sent periodically by the business manager.  If your escrow account is not up to date by July 1st,  swimmers will not be entered in the Championship meets at the end of the season.  Please note, once a swimmer is entered in a meet, the family is responsible for the meet fees.  If a child gets sick and is unable to attend a meet that they have been entered in (see meet signout policy), you are still obligated to pay those fees.  Monies leftover at the end of the season will be carried over to the next season, unless you have indicated that you will be leaving the team and request the money back.

          <p>
            We have developed a point system to encourage all families to do their share to help our team be successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            We require all families to complete 4 volunteer points for each swimmer, + 1 for each additional swimmer. The points must be earned by the end of the summer season and there will be no point carry over from season to season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone will have ample opportunity to earn their points.  Only family members 18 years or older are able to sign up for the jobs to fulfill the point requirement.  Anyone that doesn't want to work their share has the option to pay $400 before the season begins.  Any unpaid points will be accessed at $100 per point and will be charged to your account at the end of the short course season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Job Signup will be opened under the Events tab with each meet and event that require volunteers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Point donation is permitted.  If a fellow STAC family is willing to help you achieve your point commitment, it will be accepted. The person working on your family’s behalf must inform the Meet Coordinator or Event Coordinator which family they are working for or you will not get credit for the points earned.
          </p>

          <h4>Point Opportunities:</h4>
          <ul class="a">
            <li>USA Swim Official:  2 points for each meet worked.</li>
            <li>Meet Coordinator:  1.5 points for each meet worked.</li>
            <li>Meet Timer:  1 point for each meet worked.</li>
            <li>  Meet Floater .5 point for each meet worked (Not assigned a job but willing to be at the meet and fill in if needed.  Must attend timers meeting at the beginning of the meet’s session.)</li>
            <li>Activity/Social Event: .5-1 point for each completed job.</li>
            <li>Fundraising: .5-1 point for each completed job.</li>
            <li>Banquet: .5-1 point for each completed job.</li>
            <li>Create Your Own Job:  If you see a need, please don’t hesitate to step up and volunteer.  Contact administrator@njswim.org to determine if your job fills a need for the team and can earn .5-1 point.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Timing Policy:</h4>
          <p>
              We will open our Job Signup for timers under Events prior to meets for people to volunteer.  Final timing assignments will not be confirmed by our Coordinator until we get our assignments from the hosting team only days before the meet.
          </p>
              On the day of the meet all timers must check in with the STAC Timing Coordinator and attend the timers meeting before the session begins regardless of whether you have timed in the past or which half you are timing.  This is your opportunity to coordinate the “hand off” with the other timer assigned to your lane.  If you are timing for another family, please let the Timing Coordinator know who you are timing for.
          <p>
              If all of our timing positions are not filled with volunteers, we will assign the job to families that have an athlete swimming in the session.  You will have to find a replacement if you cannot time yourself.  If you cannot find a replacement, you are obligated to complete the timing assignment yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
              If you are assigned to time, but do not show up, you will be assessed $100 for the unearned point after the meet.
          </p>

          <h4>People Unable to Time:</h4>
          <p>
              If you have a medical reason that you cannot time, we ask that you declare this to us before the season begins.  We will help you find other volunteer jobs that will help the team and earn points to fulfill the family requirement.
